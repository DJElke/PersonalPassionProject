# Core Project Statement
This application will be a fun and alternative way for people who want to edit themselves or other objects into photos. They won't need to buy Photoshop or have experience using Photoshop. The application will take a picture of the person/object they want to paste onto a background image. The taken image will provide a cut-out of themselves or the object with a transparent background. This makes it easy for the user to just use this cut-out on the background image. When this image is taken, they can upload a background image to the editor application. Then they can adjust the cut-out by resizing and modifying the lightening so it blends in with the background image. The application will ask and bring out the creativity of the users. There are endless possibilities.

# Deliverables
- Taking a photo which will cut-out the person or object and will provide a new image of that cut-out without a background (transparent).
