# Core Project Statement
In the world we live in today, we have a lot of restrictions. For some companies these restrictions can be fatal, for example animal shelters. A lot of people will delay or cancel their visit to an animal shelter. It isn't attractive to go to such places. That's why I wanted to help the animal shelters and give them an alternative to present their pets to potential adopters. Also, for the visitors it can be a first impression of the animal they want to adopt. 

That's why I wanted to create an AR application, where people can see the animals through their phone or tablet. Users will be able to read information about the animal, save their favorites, ask questions and learn more about the race of the animal. Next it will be possible to book an appointment with the shelter to visit the animal.
